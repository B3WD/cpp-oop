# C++ OOP

## Purpose
These programs where created on my journey to learn object-oriented programming with C++.

## Notable mini-projects
* HangMan - A simple game of "guess the word". The repository of words can be created from any text file. This makes it easy to play within a certain theme. For example, a text about exotic gems, will cater a different experience, to a text about programming.

* sortEntireFile - Fun function that sorts an entire text file. The results look quite amusing.

* ImgManip - A simple program to manipulate the pixel values of an image. Only works with .tga extension. The program directly edits the binary data of the image.
